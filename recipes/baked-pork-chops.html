    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      These easy baked pork chops always turn out tender and juicy. The creamy
      sauce is delicious served over rice or mashed potatoes — and you probably
      have all the ingredients on hand.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 thick cut pork chops</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon seasoning salt</li>
      <li>2 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups Italian-style seasoned bread crumbs</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>⅓ cup white wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Season pork chops with garlic powder and seasoning salt. Place beaten
        eggs in a small bowl. Dredge pork chops lightly in flour; dip into
        beaten egg, then press into bread crumbs to coat both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add breaded pork
        chops and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side; transfer to
        a 9x13-inch baking dish and cover with foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Meanwhile, mix condensed soup,
        milk, and white wine in a medium bowl until well combined; pour soup
        mixture over pork chops. Replace the foil, and continue to bake for
        another 30 minutes.
